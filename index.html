      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hey! I'm Thom. I'm currently Learning, building and researching at the intersection of reinforcement learning, language and AI safety. 
        This means I'm looking to design agents that do things in a safe fashion.
        I'm particularly interested in X, and am currently seeking a PhD to do research full time.
        Check out <ahref="/research.html"><em>research</em></a>/research for more here. 
      </p>
      <p>In between graduating from Oxford and deciding to pursue research full time, I founded several successful startups.
        Before focusing on research, I founded and was head of AI at genei. 
        We use large language models to speed up research.
        We went through YC combinator in 2021 and recieved funding from some great people.
        If this excites you, we're hiring!
      </p>
      <p>During the pandemic, I founded Halo, a british biotech company performing rapid tests, serving over 100k per day.</p>
      <p>Before that, I studied at the University of Oxford.</p>
      <p>In my spare time I love running and the outdoors.</p>
